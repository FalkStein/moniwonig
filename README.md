# moniwonig

renovation plan for moni's new flat.

the todo list [todo.md](todo.md) is stored in markdown.

the markdown is converted to html using [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) by [index.html](index.html).

the result is published and displayed using gh-pages.

in other words, i can edit my web page directly in markdown.

many thanks to theo armour, who implemented this all in his [explayrimental Showdown demo for Jeremy](https://github.com/theo-armour/explayrimental/tree/gh-pages/tammik/showdown)!
